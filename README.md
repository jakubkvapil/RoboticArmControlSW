# RoboticArmControlSW
Software to control my custom robotic arm that I created as part of my master's thesis. The thesis, which also serves as documentation and includes everything needed to make this robotic arm, is available at: http://hdl.handle.net/11012/205702

The control of the arm is possible using a graphical user interface that allows to save the current position of the arm. The second way of controlling the arm is by using a Python script. A set of functions has been created for this purpose.

The software can solve both direct and inverse kinematic problems that allow positioning the robot even in a Cartesian coordinate system. This also allows the approximation of the linear motion of the robot's working point.
